# SNModManager
a simple external mod manager for Subnautica.

it works by finding the Subnautica.exe file and using its directory to find the \SNModManager\DisabledMods\ and the \BepInEx\plugins\ folders. from there it uses the folder names in the previously mentioned folders to list all mods it can find.

DLL mods like SubmersedVR are technically supported SubmersedVR specifically is a little bit finicky when it comes to working.
